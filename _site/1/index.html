    In Spring 2018 I made the decision to go a bit Carpe Diem and submit a Call for Papers (CfP) on two of my favourite technologies, Xamarin and Cognitive Services, to ProgNet 2018 in London . This is a big .NET conference organised by Skill's Matter who's CTO is none other than the legendary <a href="https://twitter.com/dylanbeattie">Dylan Beattie</a>. He is a well known face in the .NET speaking circuit, speaking regularly around the world and organising the London .NET User Group.

    As many of you know from Twitter, I became a Microsoft MVP on 1st June 2018. It's still kind of crazy to think about even a few days later but I wanted to share my thoughts, feelings and experiences that led me to get here. Many of you reading may be dreaming of becoming an MVP yourself and this might give you some idea of what you can do too.

    Welcome back everyone to Post 3 about my trip to Seattle and Microsoft Build. This post covers one of my favourite days at Build, Day 3 aka Sunday and the day I met James Montemagno! I have been talking to James quite a lot this past year but we have never had chance to meet.

    So a couple of months ago, I received an amazing message from Jim Bennett, author of Xamarin in Action and Senior Cloud Developer Advocate at Microsoft. The team is able to give tickets to the big annual Microsoft Developer conference called Build, this year held in Seattle, to people who contribute to the community and may not otherwise be able to make it; and I was the receiver of one of these tickets!

    Woah we are on the penultimate chapter, would you believe it? Time flies when you are having fun! This chapter is all about Visual Studio App Center which is like a &quot;Mission Control for apps&quot; as Jim puts it. It's a place where you can achieve multiple functions in one place. There is a quite common image used by Microsoft to describe the lifecycle in Xamarin:

    Welcome back! Today we will go ahead and look at Chapter 14 which covers UI testing. In the last chapter we learned how to deploy to our local devices but now we need to check the user interactions and ensure the app performs as expected when interacted with including correct bindings and appropriate components.
