         We are here! Part 3 of the book. This is all about getting you from a working app to the store. Obviously having a working application is a good start but that is not everything to get it app store ready.

         That’s right everyone, I am back with yet another post about Xamarin in Action. It has only been a few days since I released the last post but something big has happened in that time. Manning Publications, the publisher of the book have seen my posts and decided to share them on Twitter, wow!

         I intended to try and space out the posts to one a week or something to avoid bombarding you with too many posts and giving me breathing room to take on the code. But a mixture of excitement, enjoyment of the book and the first chapter being more of a casual introduction, has led me to start writing this, the day after the last one!

         So I recently purchased an early-access copy of the book Xamarin in Action by Jim Bennett, Cloud Developer Advocate at Microsoft. If you too want to purchase a copy of this book (which I highly recommend) then you can find it <a href="https://t.co/RrRBSM3X5l">here</a>. Note: I used a discount code of “ssbennett” to get 42% off the cover price, you’re welcome ;)
