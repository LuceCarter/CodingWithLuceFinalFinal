         Last year you may recall I wrote <a href="https://lucecarter.co.uk/the-story-of-hack-manchester-2017-and-why-i-am-thrilled-to-become-runner-up/">this post</a> about my experience at Hack Manchester 2017. My mentor and I worked together to create a mobile app aimed at helping women going through menopausal symptoms track their hot flushes and change in mood to help them, their support network and medical professionals spot patterns. You can read that post for more detail.
