  I don't often do reviews of the year. But with the decade ending and a lot changing in 2019, in terms of the content I create specifically, it seemed like a good idea!

  <a href="https://lucecarter.co.uk/how-software-development-saved-my-life/">My story into tech is no secret</a>. I was severely depressed and lonely, went to college where I discovered programming and a classmate taught me C# which changed my life! That is what led me to studying Software Engineering at Manchester Met University and never looking back!

    </br>
  </br>
  So first of all, thanks for visiting my blog!
You may notice it is lacking my 3 most recent posts right now. That is 100% my fault.

  Last year you may recall I wrote <a href="https://lucecarter.co.uk/the-story-of-hack-manchester-2017-and-why-i-am-thrilled-to-become-runner-up/">this post</a> about my experience at Hack Manchester 2017. My mentor and I worked together to create a mobile app aimed at helping women going through menopausal symptoms track their hot flushes and change in mood to help them, their support network and medical professionals spot patterns. You can read that post for more detail.

      </h1>

    </br>
  </br>
  It's that time in this series! Day 4, Monday morning. Time for the keynote! I set off bright and early for WSCC in the hope of making the front row. Being 'vertically challenged' as they say means if I am too far back I always have heads in the way.
