      </h1>

  </br>
  Back in January 2017, I was assigned a mentor through the SheSaysMcr Mentoring scheme. I was lucky enough to be introduced to the great <a href="https://twitter.com/ClareSudbery">Clare Sudbery</a>. Meeting Clare has been fantastic for me. Not only for career advice but also the friendship I have gained with someone wise who is always on hand to help me improve my professional and personal skills. I would recommend getting a mentor to anyone!

  So following on from my previous post that can be found <a href="https://lucecarter.co.uk/posts/mvp-rd-cl-day1">here</a>, this is my summary of yet another successful day at the event at the National Space Centre in Leicester.

      </h1>

    </br>
  </br>
  Being the founder and organiser of Manchester Xamarin User Group means Microsoft considers me a ‘Community Leader’, which means this year I was delighted to be invited to the big annual community event that they host.

  So I have been thinking for a while now about writing a blog, maybe even getting into public speaking and I was never sure where to start. I decided on a topic close to my heart, Code, and how much it means to me.
