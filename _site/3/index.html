            <h3 class="post-title">The Story Of Hack Manchester 2017 And Why I Am Thrilled To Become Runner Up</h3>
        </a>

        <p class="post-excerpt">
         Back in January 2017, I was assigned a mentor through the SheSaysMcr Mentoring scheme. I was lucky enough to be introduced to the great <a href="https://twitter.com/ClareSudbery">Clare Sudbery</a>. Meeting Clare has been fantastic for me. Not only for career advice but also the friendship I have gained with someone wise who is always on hand to help me improve my professional and personal skills. I would recommend getting a mentor to anyone!

         Being the founder and organiser of Manchester Xamarin User Group means Microsoft considers me a ‘Community Leader’, which means this year I was delighted to be invited to the big annual community event that they host.

         So I have been thinking for a while now about writing a blog, maybe even getting into public speaking and I was never sure where to start. I decided on a topic close to my heart, Code, and how much it means to me.
