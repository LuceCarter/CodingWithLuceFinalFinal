title: How to copy and paste in the CLI for both Mac and Windows

I recently received an email from someone, asking me how to copy and paste into the command-line interface (CLI) because they were trying to add some credentials for the [Twilio CLI](https://www.twilio.com/docs/twilio-cli/quickstart).

I realised that it isn't actually that obvious, as the traditional shortcuts we are used to (ctrl/cmd + c/v) don't always work depending on the operating system and CLI shell you are using. It prompted me to create [this Youtube video](https://youtu.be/hXvOm4cFI_0) showing how to do it. However we all consume content in different ways, so I thought I would also write this post for you in case you prefer written instructions.


## Windows

I will start with Windows as this can be the most counter-intuitive. I have tested this in both Command Prompt and Powershell, which are the two most common CLI tools that you get out of the box with Windows.

### Copy

This can be done as you would expect, with ctrl + c or using the mouse to select what you wish to copy from CLI and using right-click. Instead of bringing up a context menu, this simply copies whatever you have highlighted.

### Paste

For some, the traditional ctrl + v will work, however your experience may vary. If pasting with ctrl + v isn't working for you, a simple right-click will actually paste what is currently on your clipboard! 

## Mac

I tested this on both the default Terminal and the choice of many of us, iTerm 2 and the results were the same. 
On Mac things are as you would expect.

### Copy

This is as you would expect, cmd + c will copy whatever is selected. You can also right-click the highlighted text and click copy.

### Paste

Just like with copy, this is the usual cmd + v to paste and you can also do right-click and paste. Easy!!

## Summary

So there you have it, a quick written guide on how to copy and paste in CLI on both Mac and Windows. I hope you have found this helpful!

You can of course tweet me if you have any questions or wish to see another topic coverd as a video and/or blog post. Thanks for reading! :)
